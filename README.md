Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to make apps using Javascript.  I got hugh inspireation from weather.com link is https://weather.com/


Development stack
Flow was enabled to catch typing errors in React Native JavaScript code

APIs
Weather data is retrieved from https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
Note about API data
The weather data retrived from Weather Api is not very accurate. Most of the time, the weather forecast is not correct.
